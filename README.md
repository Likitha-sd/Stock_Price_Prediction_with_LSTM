# Stock Price Predictor using LSTM (Deep Learning)

## Overview
Predicting stock prices using deep learning is a core skill in fintech, quant trading, and data science. This project leverages an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict future stock closing prices based on historical trends.

Built using Python, Keras, and real stock data via Yahoo Finance API — this project is your step into time-series modeling and deep learning.
